# Variables and Assignments

## Intro
The most common task in any programming language is assigning data to a variable. Most often, you have some expression to the right of the assignment operator (`=`, which is not an "equals sign" in most programming languages), which is then *assigned* to the left hand side. How exactly this happens depends on the programming language. If you want to know how it happens in Python, check out the [References](#References) section.

## Tasks
1. Figure out what characters can and cannot go in a Python variable name. Try random punctuation symbols. See if variables can start with numbers. See if they can end with numbers. Can you include the "`_`" symbol? Where?
2. Do the following steps in order in your script (program). Assign the value `3` to `x`. Print `x`. Assign `x` to `y`. Print `y`. Assign `4` to `x`. Print `y`. Has `y` changed by changing `x`?

## References
If you want to learn more about variable assignment in Python, I suggest starting with "A Student's Guide to Physical Modeling in Python" on page 119. It has a great, low-level (meaning more difficult and non-abstract) explanation for what's happening "under the hood".
