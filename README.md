# Python Exercises

## Purpose
This is intended to be a collection of exercises to learn Python by doing. So do them. And learn.

## Organization
Exercises will (eventually) be put into folders based on topic. They should all start with one of the following letters: e, m, h. These are easy, medium, and hard. So the filename would be something like `e_TwoBodyProblem.md`. Click on it and you will see the exercise.

## Answer Key
Make one if you want. Make an account on Github, and learn how to do the following: fork this repository, create a new branch, make edits (or just submit your own answer if there's no answer there already), and then submit a pull request. GitHub explains what all of these are and more in their nice Tutorial when you make an account.
