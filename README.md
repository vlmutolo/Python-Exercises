# Python Exercises

## Purpose
This is intended to be a collection of exercises to learn Python by doing. So do them. And learn.

## Organization
Exercises will (eventually) be put into folders based on topic. They should all start with one of the following letters: e, m, h. These are easy, medium, and hard. So the filename would be something like `e_TwoBodyProblem.md`. Click on it and you will see the exercise.

## Answer Key
Make one if you want. Make an account on Github, and learn how to do the following: fork this repository, create a new branch, make edits (or just submit your own answer if there's no answer there already), and then submit a pull request. GitHub explains what all of these are and more in their nice Tutorial when you make an account.

All of this is good exercise, but kind of beside the point to learning Python for scientific computing.

## Resources
There will be several books and other things referenced frequently as a place to look for information. An up-to-date list is given below of all of them:
